This project leverages a regular camera device to perform real-time quality detection of fruits and vegetables. The system captures live image or video data and applies advanced image processing and machine learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automatically identify freshness, defects, and spoilage indicators.

Core features include:

Continuous, real-time monitoring of produce quality
Automatic classification of fruits and vegetables based on color, texture, and visible defects.
